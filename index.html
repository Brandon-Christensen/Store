            Hi, we are RGB. We are a company that believes that the true Primary
            <br>
            colors are actually Red, Blue, and Green. As a result of this 
            <br>
            we created a company that only sells products that are strictyly Red, Green, abd Blue.
            <br>
            As a company we strive to cure the world of false primary colors use (the false primary colors being Red, Yellow, and Blue). 
            <br>
            We welcome you to our humble store RGB!!!
