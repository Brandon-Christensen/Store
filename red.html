            When I was a child I looked through the m&m's that my

        <p>
            These salmon are a seasonal item in our shop. These
            <br>
            types of salmon are only red once they are ready to spawn.
            <br>
            As a result of this, we only have a limited supply.
            <br>
            Price: $5.99
